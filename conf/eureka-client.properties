###Eureka Client configuration for Sample Eureka Client

# see the README in eureka-examples to see an overview of the example set up

# note that for a purely client usage (e.g. only used to get information about other services,
# there is no need for registration. This property applies to the singleton DiscoveryClient so
# if you run a server that is both a service provider and also a service consumer,
# then don't set this property to false.
eureka.registration.enabled=true

eureka.name=USER_CENTER
# what is my application virtual ip address? (clients can query on this vipAddress)
#eureka.vipAddress=192.168.3.227

eureka.instanceId=user-center-eureka-1

# what is the port that I serve on? (Change this if port 8001 is already in use in your environment)
